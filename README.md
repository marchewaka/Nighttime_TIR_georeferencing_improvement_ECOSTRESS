# Nighttime_TIR_georeferencing_improvement_ECOSTRESS
The programs use h5 files of ECOSTRESS, georeference them and use Google-Earth-Engine created masks as matching reference.

requires following packages: 
numpy
rasterio
pyplot
os
scipy
time
sys
copy
h5py
cv2
itertools
re
datetime
glob
gdal

In initial_georeferencing.py the paths need to be adapted. The program outputs GeoTiff images with name ending with '_georef.tif'. Three tif files are created: image file (LSTE), and annotation files to access quality flags from h5 file: _orig_px_coord_y- or x.tif 
The three files are further used in georeferencing improvement script.

In georeferencing_improvement.py, the variables that can/should be edited are placed up front. 
Please adapt paths to match your folder structure. The georeferenced files are expected to end with _georef.tif, change if needed. 
To create plots of matched water body edges, set the variable create_control_plots to True. 
The output of the script is a GeoTiff image and txt file with parameters: tie point locations and fitted transformation parameters.
It is possible to include scaling in the transformation, but the minimum number of tie points needs to be adapted. 
The txt file 'code_description.txt' is a description of the georeferencing_improvement.py processing step for step.
